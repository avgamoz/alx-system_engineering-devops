<p>The Webstack debugging series will train you in the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that’s the “fun” part of the job!). <b>
Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.<b>This is one among the <b>Webstack debugging series</b> of projects where I will be given <b>broken/bugged webstacks. The final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, it will bring the webstack to a working state.</b></p>
